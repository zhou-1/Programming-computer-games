You can control the red block (plane) with W,S,A,D for front,back,left,right direction.
Three random missles with different kinds of sizes and speed in every game will move in random tracks.
You need to move plane to explore the limitations, once your plane touch the limitation of space, you will lose one life, 
there are nine lives at beginning.
Also, once you click the mouse, the whole background will turn into yellow.
Have fun!
