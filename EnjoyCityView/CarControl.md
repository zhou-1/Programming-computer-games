During my game, there are four different objects (grey box buildings, two different rotated cubes, 
one basic object from AOI and one colorful pyramid). The goal here is controlling the red sphere which is a car in the game 
to touch the white box in front of the car. 
We use up key to go ahead, left key to turn left and right key to turn right. Once you touched the box, 
a crash audio will play and one text “one score, you won” will show up!     

Due to the limit time, I cannot develop more on detecting on collision with buildings and car.
